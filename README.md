This is my set of utility functions for Java 8 and JavaFX development
They break down into gui, model and util files
utils are generally public static functions to facilitate file io, urls, parsing, hashing, node traversal
model is mostly the database layer with maps and Data Abstraction Objects (DAO) 
gui contains support for fontAwesome icons, animators to make borderpanes use drawers, visibility animatoars
