This is my set of utility functions for Java 8 and JavaFX development<p>
They break down into <ul>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<li>animation</li> 
<li>gui</li> 
<li>icon</li> 
<li>model </li> 
<li>task</li> 
<li>util</li> 


animation has a variety of transitions and node animations that come from JideFX<p>

gui has predefined Borders, Effects, Backgrounds, Cursors and classes to make borderpanes use drawers, visibility animators<p>

utils are generally public static functions to facilitate file io, urls, parsing, hashing, node traversal<p>

model is mostly the database layer with maps, Data Abstraction Objects (DAO), File streams, data formats, etc <p>

icon contains support for fontAwesome icons
