This is my set of utility functions for Java 8 and JavaFX development<p>
They break down into gui, model and util files<p>
utils are generally public static functions to facilitate file io, urls, parsing, hashing, node traversal<p>
model is mostly the database layer with maps and Data Abstraction Objects (DAO) <p>
gui contains support for fontAwesome icons, animators to make borderpanes use drawers, visibility animatoars
