/**
 * {@code DecorationSupport} is an interface that indicates a Region can be a host for decorations created by {@link
 * Decorator}. {@link DecorationPane} is a host for decorations and it will cover majorities of the use cases for
 * decorations. However, in cases of TableColumnHeader, TableCell, ListCell, TreeCell, etc. that are inside a {@code
 * VirtualFlow}, using {@code DecorationPane} directly is not practical. That's why we abstracted this interface so that
 * those regions can implement it to provide its own dedicated support for decorations.
 * <p/>
 * Both methods below are on the {@link javafx.scene.layout.Region} but as protected so we can't call them directly from
 * outside. So by exposing them on this interface, we can call them from outside so that we can add decoration nodes and
 * position them at the location we wanted.
 * <p/>
 * When you implement this interface, all your need to do is to add the following implementation of both methods.
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * public ObservableList&lt;Node&gt; getChildren() {
 *    return super.getChildren();
 * }
 *
 * public void positionInArea(Node child, double areaX, double areaY, double areaWidth, double areaHeight, double
 * areaBaselineOffset, HPos halignment, VPos valignment) {
 *     super.positionInArea(child, areaX, areaY, areaWidth, areaHeight, areaBaselineOffset, halignment, valignment);
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see DecorationDelegate more details.
